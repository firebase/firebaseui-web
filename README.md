# FirebaseUI for Web — Auth

FirebaseUI is an open-source JavaScript library for Web that provides simple, customizable UI
bindings on top of [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) SDKs to eliminate boilerplate code and
promote best practices.

FirebaseUI Auth provides a drop-in auth solution that handles the UI flows for signing in users with
email addresses and passwords, and Identity Provider Sign In using Google, Facebook and others.
It is built on top of [Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth).

The FirebaseUI component implements best practices for authentication on mobile devices and
websites, helping to sign-in and sign-up conversion for your app. It also handles cases like account
recovery and account linking that can be security sensitive and error-prone to handle.

FirebaseUI Auth clients are also available for [iOS](https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-ios) and
[Android](https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-android).

FirebaseUI fully supports all recent browsers. Signing in with federated providers (Google,
Facebook, Twitter, Github) is not yet supported in non-browser environments (Cordova, React Native,
Ionic...) nor Chrome extensions.

## Installation

You just need to include the following script and CSS file in the `<head>` tag of your page,
below the initialization snippet from the Firebase Console:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.firebase.com/libs/firebaseui/1.0.0/firebaseui.js"></script>
<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.firebase.com/libs/firebaseui/1.0.0/firebaseui.css" />
```

You can also install FirebaseUI via npm or Bower and its dependencies will be downloaded
automatically:

```bash
$ npm install firebaseui --save
```

```bash
$ bower install firebaseui --save
```

You can then serve your app locally using `firebase serve`.

## Using FirebaseUI for Authentication

FirebaseUI includes the following flows:

1. Interaction with Identity Providers such as Google and Facebook
2. Sign-up and sign-in with email accounts
3. Password reset
4. Prevention of account duplication (activated when *"One account per email address"* setting is
enabled in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com). This setting is enabled by
default.)
5. [Account Chooser](https://www.accountchooser.com/learnmore.html?lang=en) for remembering emails

### Configuring sign-in providers

To use FirebaseUI to authenticate users you first need to configure each provider you want to use in
their own developer app settings. Please read the *Before you begin* section of Firebase
Authentication at the following links:

- [Email and password](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/password-auth#before_you_begin)
- [Google](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/google-signin#before_you_begin)
- [Facebook](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/facebook-login#before_you_begin)
- [Twitter](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/twitter-login#before_you_begin)
- [Github](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/github-auth#before_you_begin)

### Starting the sign-in flow

You first need to initialize your
[Firebase app](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#prerequisites). The `firebase.auth.Auth`
instance should be passed to the constructor of `firebaseui.auth.AuthUI`. You can then call the
`start` method with the CSS selector that determines where to create the widget, and a configuration
object.

The following example shows how to set up a sign-in screen with all supported providers. Please
refer to the [demo application in the examples folder](demo/) for a more in-depth
example, showcasing a Single Page Application mode.

> Firebase and FirebaseUI do not work when executed directly from a file (i.e. opening the file in
> your browser, not through a web server). Always run `firebase serve` (or your preferred local
> server) to test your app locally.

### Credential Helper

The role of a credential helper is to help your users sign into you website.
When one is enabled, your users will be prompted with email addresses and
usernames they have saved from your app or other applications. To achieve this,
[accountchooser.com](https://www.accountchooser.com/learnmore.html) is
available. Upon signing in or signing up with email, the user will be redirected
to the accountchooser.com website and will be able to select one of their saved
accounts. It is recommended to use this, but you can also disable it by
specifying the value below.

|Credential Helper |Value                                                 |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
|accountchooser.com|`firebaseui.auth.CredentialHelper.ACCOUNT_CHOOSER_COM`|
|None (disable)    |`firebaseui.auth.CredentialHelper.NONE`               |

### Available providers

|Provider          |Value                                           |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
|Google            |`firebase.auth.GoogleAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID`  |
|Facebook          |`firebase.auth.FacebookAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID`|
|Twitter           |`firebase.auth.TwitterAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID` |
|Github            |`firebase.auth.GithubAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID`  |
|Email and password|`firebase.auth.EmailAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID`   |

### Custom scopes

To specify custom scopes per provider, you can pass an object instead of just the provider value:

```javascript
ui.start('#firebaseui-auth-container', {
  signInOptions = [
    {
      provider: firebase.auth.GoogleAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID,
      scopes: [
        'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.login'
      ]
    },
    {
      provider: firebase.auth.FacebookAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID,
      scopes: [
        'public_profile',
        'email',
        'user_likes',
        'user_friends'
      ]
    },
    firebase.auth.TwitterAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID, // Twitter does not support scopes.
    firebase.auth.EmailAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID // Other providers don't need to be given as object.
  ]
});
```

### Sign In Flows

Two sign in flows are available:

- `redirect`, the default, will perform a full page redirect to the sign-in page of the provider
(Google, Facebook...). This is recommended for mobile apps.
- The `popup` flow will open a popup to the sign-in page of the provider. If the popup is blocked by
the browser, it will fall back to a full page redirect.

### Available callbacks

Currently only one callback is supported. Some will be added soon to monitor UI changes.

`signInSuccess(currentUser, credential, redirectUrl)`

**Parameters:**

|Name         |Type                          | Optional|Description                                                                                                                                                              |
|-------------|------------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`currentUser`|`firebase.User`               |No       |The logged in user.                                                                                                                                                      |
|`credential` |`firebase.auth.AuthCredential`|Yes      |The credential used to sign in the user.                                                                                                                                  |
|`redirectUrl`|`string`                      |Yes      |The URL where the user is redirected after the callback finishes. It will only be given if you [overwrite the sign-in success URL](#overwriting-the-sign-in-success-url).|

**Should return: `boolean`**

If the callback returns `true`, then the page is automatically redirected depending on the case:

- If no `signInSuccessUrl` parameter was given in the URL (See:
[Overwriting the sign-in success URL](#overwriting-the-sign-in-success-url)) then the default
`signInSuccessUrl` in config is used.
- If the value is provided in the URL, that value will be used instead of the static
`signInSuccessUrl` in config.

If the callback returns `false` or nothing, the page is not automatically redirected.

## Customizing FirebaseUI for authentication

Currently, FirebaseUI does not offer customization out of the box. However, the HTML around the
widget is not affected by it so you can display everything you want around the widget container.

## Advanced

### FirebaseUI widget modes

Upon initialization, FirebaseUI will look for the `mode` parameter in the URL. Depending on the value
of this parameter, it will trigger a specific mode. When no `mode` parameter is found, it will
default to the sign-in mode.

You can change the name of this parameter with the `queryParameterForWidgetMode` configuration
parameter.

|Query parameter value|Description |
|---------------------|------------|
|`?mode=select`       |Sign-in mode|

**Example:**

    https://<url-of-the-widget>?mode=select

### Overwriting the sign-in success URL

You can pass a query parameter to the widget's URL that will overwrite the URL the user is
redirected to after a successful sign-in. If you do so, you must set the configuration
`signInSuccessUrl` value (even if it will be overwritten). When passing the redirect URL this way,
the `signInSuccess` callback will receive the value as the `redirectUrl` argument.

You **must include the mode explicitly** in the URL when using the `signInSuccessUrl` parameter,
otherwise FirebaseUI will directly redirect to the URL specified.

You can change the name of this parameter with the `queryParameterForSignInSuccessUrl` configuration
parameter.

**Example:**

`https://<url-of-the-widget>?mode=select&signInSuccessUrl=signedIn.html` will redirect the user to
`https://<url-of-the-widget>/signedIn.html` after a successful sign-in flow.

## Developer Setup

### Dependencies

To set up a development environment to build FirebaseUI from source, you must
have the following installed:
- Node.js (>= 6.0.0)
- npm (should be included with Node.js)
- Java Runtime Environment

In order to run the demo and tests, you must also have:
- Python (2.7)

Download the FirebaseUI source and its dependencies with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-web.git
cd firebaseui-web
npm install
```

### Building FirebaseUI

To build the library, run:
```bash
npm run build
```

This will create output files in the `dist/` folder.

### Running the demo app

To run the demo app, you must have a Firebase project set up on the
[Firebase Console](https://firebase.google.com/console). Copy
`demo/public/sample-config.js` to `demo/public/config.js`:

```bash
cp demo/public/sample-config.js demo/public/config.js
```

Copy the data from the "Add Firebase to your web app" flow in Firebase Console.
Next, run

```bash
npm run demo
```

This will start a local server serving a FirebaseUI demo app with all local
changes. More details can be found in the [demo app folder](demo/), covering
how to configure the app to be deployed on a Firebase Hosting instance.

### Running unit tests.

All unit tests can be run on the command line (via PhantomJS) with:

```bash
npm test
```

Alternatively, the unit tests can be run manually by running

```bash
npm run serve
```

Then, all unit tests can be run at: http://localhost:4000/buildtools/all_tests.html
You can also run tests individually by accessing each HTML file under
`generated/tests`, for example: http://localhost:4000/generated/tests/javascript/widgets/authui_test.html

## Known issues

### Firebase Auth does not work in Safari private browsing

When a user has enabled the private browsing mode in Safari, the web storage is disabled. This
currently results in an error being thrown upon Firebase Auth initialization. Therefore, when
following the snippets above, FirebaseUI will never get initialized and no UI will be displayed.

### Tips for Single Page apps (`UI Widget is already rendered on the page` warning)

When re-rendering the FirebaseUI Auth widget (for instance after signing in a user, signing her out
and trying to sign her in again), it will sometimes log a warning: `UI Widget is already rendered on
the page and is pending some user interaction. Only one widget instance can be rendered per page.
The previous instance has been automatically reset.`. This happens when the UI widget was in a
pending state, i.e. the user was in the middle of performing a sign-in flow. You should generally
avoid re-rendering the widget in the middle of an action, but if you do, to avoid the warning, you
should use the `reset()` method before re-rendering the widget.

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0

See the milestone [1.0.0](https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-web/milestone/2) for the issues
covered in this release. Below is a summary of the most important ones:

- **FirebaseUI is now open source!** To contribute, please first create an issue describing either
the bug observed or the feature requested. This way we can discuss the relevance of the feature,
before you start working on it. It is also usually better to express the bug before working on a
fix.
- Added an option to disable Account Chooser. See: [Credential Helper](credential-helper).

### 0.5.0

See the milestone [0.5.0](https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-web/milestone/1) for the issues
covered in this release. Below is a summary of the most important ones:

- FirebaseUI now supports **Single Page Application**: a `reset` method was added to allow to
dispose of the widget. When the user leaves a page where the FirebaseUI widget was rendered (for
instance in the `componentWillUnmount` method of a React component), call the `reset` method of the
`firebaseui.auth.AuthUI` instance you created. Also, call the `reset` method before rendering
again the widget if one has already been rendered on the page. Please refer to the
[demo app](demo/) for guidance on how to use FirebaseUI in a Single Page
Application context.
- **Custom scopes** can now be added for each provider. See [Custom Scopes](custom-scopes).
- Several issues, different but related to the `displayName` not being present after sign up with
email and password, have been fixed.
- A new config parameter has been added: `signInFlow`. It allows to specify whether the Identity
Providers sign in flows should be done through `redirect` (the default) or `popup`. See
[Sign In Flows](sign-in-flows).
