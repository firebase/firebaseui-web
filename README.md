# FirebaseUI for Web — Auth

FirebaseUI is an open-source JavaScript library for Web that provides simple,
customizable UI bindings on top of [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) SDKs
to eliminate boilerplate code and promote best practices.

FirebaseUI Auth provides a drop-in auth solution that handles the UI flows for
signing in users with email addresses and passwords, and Identity Provider Sign
In using Google, Facebook and others. It is built on top of
[Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth).

The FirebaseUI component implements best practices for authentication on mobile
devices and websites, helping to sign-in and sign-up conversion for your app. It
also handles cases like account recovery and account linking that can be
security sensitive and error-prone to handle.

FirebaseUI Auth clients are also available for
[iOS](https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-ios) and
[Android](https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-android).

FirebaseUI fully supports all recent browsers. Signing in with federated
providers (Google, Facebook, Twitter, Github) is also supported in
Cordova/Ionic environments. Additional non-browser environments (React
Native...) or Chrome extensions will be added once the underlying Firebase core
SDK supports them in a way that is compatible with FirebaseUI.

## Demo

Accessible here:
[https://fir-ui-demo-84a6c.firebaseapp.com](https://fir-ui-demo-84a6c.firebaseapp.com).

## Installation

### Option 1: CDN

You just need to include the following script and CSS file in the `<head>` tag
of your page, below the initialization snippet from the Firebase Console:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.firebase.com/libs/firebaseui/3.0.0/firebaseui.js"></script>
<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.firebase.com/libs/firebaseui/3.0.0/firebaseui.css" />
```

#### Localized Widget

Localized versions of the widget are available through the CDN. To use a localized widget, load the
localized JS library instead of the default library:

```html
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/ui/3.0.0/firebase-ui-auth__{LANGUAGE_CODE}.js"></script>
<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/ui/3.0.0/firebase-ui-auth.css" />
```

where `{LANGUAGE_CODE}` is replaced by the code of the language you want. For example, the French
version of the library is available at
`https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/ui/3.0.0/firebase-ui-auth__fr.js`. The list of available
languages and their respective language codes can be found at [LANGUAGES.md](LANGUAGES.md).

Right-to-left languages also require the right-to-left version of the stylesheet, available at
`https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/ui/3.0.0/firebase-ui-auth-rtl.css`, instead of the default
stylesheet. The supported right-to-left languages are Arabic (ar), Farsi (fa), and Hebrew (iw).

### Option 2: npm Module

Install FirebaseUI and its dependencies via npm using the following command:

```bash
$ npm install firebaseui --save
```

You can then `require` the following modules within your source files:

```javascript
var firebase = require('firebase');
var firebaseui = require('firebaseui');
// or for ES6 imports.
import * as firebaseui from 'firebaseui'
```

Or include the required files in your HTML, if your HTTP Server serves the files
within `node_modules/`:

```html
<script src="node_modules/firebaseui/dist/firebaseui.js"></script>
<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/firebaseui/dist/firebaseui.css" />
```

### Option 3: Bower component

Install FirebaseUI and its dependencies via Bower using the following command:

```bash
$ bower install firebaseui --save
```

You can then include the required files in your HTML, if your HTTP Server serves
the files within `bower_components/`:

```html
<script src="bower_components/firebaseui/dist/firebaseui.js"></script>
<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="bower_components/firebaseui/dist/firebaseui.css" />
```

## Using FirebaseUI for Authentication

FirebaseUI includes the following flows:

1. Interaction with Identity Providers such as Google and Facebook
2. Phone number based authentication
3. Sign-up and sign-in with email accounts
4. Password reset
5. Prevention of account duplication (activated when
*"One account per email address"* setting is enabled in the
[Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com). This setting is enabled
by default.)
6. [Account Chooser](https://www.accountchooser.com/learnmore.html?lang=en) for
remembering emails
7. Integration with
[one-tap sign-up](https://developers.google.com/identity/one-tap/web/overview)
8. Ability to upgrade anonymous users through sign-in/sign-up.

### Configuring sign-in providers

To use FirebaseUI to authenticate users you first need to configure each
provider you want to use in their own developer app settings. Please read the
*Before you begin* section of Firebase Authentication at the following links:

- [Phone number](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/phone-auth)
- [Email and password](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/password-auth#before_you_begin)
- [Google](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/google-signin#before_you_begin)
- [Facebook](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/facebook-login#before_you_begin)
- [Twitter](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/twitter-login#before_you_begin)
- [Github](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/github-auth#before_you_begin)

### Starting the sign-in flow

You first need to initialize your
[Firebase app](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#prerequisites). The
`firebase.auth.Auth` instance should be passed to the constructor of
`firebaseui.auth.AuthUI`. You can then call the `start` method with the CSS
selector that determines where to create the widget, and a configuration object.

The following example shows how to set up a sign-in screen with all supported
providers. Please refer to the [demo application in the examples folder](demo/)
for a more in-depth example, showcasing a Single Page Application mode.

> Firebase and FirebaseUI do not work when executed directly from a file (i.e.
> opening the file in your browser, not through a web server). Always run
> `firebase serve` (or your preferred local server) to test your app locally.

    <script type="text/javascript">
      // FirebaseUI config.
      var uiConfig = {
        signInSuccessUrl: '<url-to-redirect-to-on-success>',
        signInOptions: [
          // Leave the lines as is for the providers you want to offer your users.
          firebase.auth.GoogleAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID,
          firebase.auth.FacebookAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID,
          firebase.auth.TwitterAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID,
          firebase.auth.GithubAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID,
          firebase.auth.EmailAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID,
          firebase.auth.PhoneAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID
        ],
        // Terms of service url.
        tosUrl: '<your-tos-url>'
      };

      // Initialize the FirebaseUI Widget using Firebase.
      var ui = new firebaseui.auth.AuthUI(firebase.auth());
      // The start method will wait until the DOM is loaded.
      ui.start('#firebaseui-auth-container', uiConfig);
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- The surrounding HTML is left untouched by FirebaseUI.
         Your app may use that space for branding, controls and other customizations.-->
    <h1>Welcome to My Awesome App</h1>
    <div id="firebaseui-auth-container"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

**This is only relevant for single page apps or apps where the sign-in UI is rendered conditionally (e.g. button click)**

When redirecting back from accountchooser.com or Identity Providers like Google
and Facebook, `start()` method needs to be called to finish the sign-in flow.
If it requires a user interaction to start the initial sign-in process, you need to 
check if there is a pending redirect operation going on on page load to check whether `start()` 
needs to be called.

To check if there is a pending redirect operation to complete a sign-in attempt,
check `isPendingRedirect()` before deciding whether to render FirebaseUI
via `start()`.

```javascript
if (ui.isPendingRedirect()) {
  ui.start('#firebaseui-auth-container', uiConfig);
}
```

Here is how you would track the Auth state across all your pages:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">

       ***************************************************************************************** -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
      initApp = function() {
        firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged(function(user) {
          if (user) {
            // User is signed in.
            var displayName = user.displayName;
            var email = user.email;
            var emailVerified = user.emailVerified;
            var photoURL = user.photoURL;
            var uid = user.uid;
            var phoneNumber = user.phoneNumber;
            var providerData = user.providerData;
            user.getIdToken().then(function(accessToken) {
              document.getElementById('sign-in-status').textContent = 'Signed in';
              document.getElementById('sign-in').textContent = 'Sign out';
              document.getElementById('account-details').textContent = JSON.stringify({

                uid: uid,
                accessToken: accessToken,
                providerData: providerData
              }, null, '  ');
            });
          } else {
            // User is signed out.
            document.getElementById('sign-in-status').textContent = 'Signed out';
            document.getElementById('sign-in').textContent = 'Sign in';
            document.getElementById('account-details').textContent = 'null';
          }
        }, function(error) {
          console.log(error);
        });
      };

      window.addEventListener('load', function() {
        initApp()
      });
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Awesome App</h1>
    <div id="sign-in-status"></div>
    <div id="sign-in"></div>
    <div id="account-details"></div>
  </body>
</html>

```

### Credential Helper

The role of a credential helper is to help your users sign into you website.
When one is enabled, your users will be prompted with email addresses and
usernames they have saved from your app or other applications.
FirebaseUI supports the following credential helpers:

- [one-tap sign-up](https://developers.google.com/identity/one-tap/web/overview)
- [accountchooser.com](https://www.accountchooser.com/learnmore.html)

#### accountchooser.com

When [accountchooser.com](https://www.accountchooser.com/learnmore.html) is
enabled (enabled by default), upon signing in or
signing up with email, the user will be redirected to the accountchooser.com
website and will be able to select one of their saved accounts. You can
disable it by specifying the value below. This feature is always disabled for
non HTTP/HTTPS environments.

#### One-tap sign-up

[One-tap sign-up](https://developers.google.com/identity/one-tap/web/overview)
provides seamless authentication flows to
your users with Google's one tap sign-up and automatic sign-in APIs.
With one tap sign-up, users are prompted to create an account with a dialog
that's inline with FirebaseUI NASCAR screen. With just one tap, they get a
secure, token-based, passwordless account with your service, protected by their
Google Account. As the process is frictionless, users are much more likely to
register.
Returning users are signed in automatically, even when they switch devices or
platforms, or after their session expires.
One-tap sign-up integrates with FirebaseUI and if you request Google OAuth
scopes, you will still get back the expected Google OAuth access token even if
the user goes through the one-tap flow. However, in that case 'redirect' flow is
always used even when 'popup' is specified.
In addition, if you choose to force prompt for Google sign-in, one-tap auto
sign-in will be automatically disabled.
One-tap is an additive feature and is only supported in the latest evergreen
modern browser environments.
For more information on how to configure one-tap sign-up, refer to the
[one-tap get started guide](https://developers.google.com/identity/one-tap/web/get-started).

The following example shows how to configure one-tap sign-up with FirebaseUI.
Along with the corresponding one-tap `credentialHelper`, `clientId` and
`authMethod` have to be provided with the Firebase Google provider:

```javascript
ui.start('#firebaseui-auth-container', {
  signInOptions: [
    {
      // Google provider must be enabled in Firebase Console to support one-tap
      // sign-up.
      provider: firebase.auth.GoogleAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID,
      // Required to enable this provider in one-tap sign-up.
      authMethod: 'https://accounts.google.com',
      // Required to enable ID token credentials for this provider.
      // This can be obtained from the Credentials page of the Google APIs
      // console.
      clientId: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com'
    },
    firebase.auth.FacebookAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID,
    firebase.auth.TwitterAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID,
    firebase.auth.GithubAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID,
    firebase.auth.EmailAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID,
  ],
  // Required to enable one-tap sign-up credential helper.
  credentialHelper: firebaseui.auth.CredentialHelper.GOOGLE_YOLO
});
// Auto sign-in for returning users is enabled by default except when prompt is
// not 'none' in the Google provider custom parameters. To manually disable:
ui.disableAutoSignIn();
```

Auto sign-in for returning users can be disabled by calling
`ui.disableAutoSignIn()`. This may be needed if the FirebaseUI sign-in page is
being rendered after the user signs out.

To see FirebaseUI in action with one-tap sign-up, check out the FirebaseUI
[demo app](https://fir-ui-demo-84a6c.firebaseapp.com/).

|Credential Helper |Value                                                 |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
|accountchooser.com|`firebaseui.auth.CredentialHelper.ACCOUNT_CHOOSER_COM`|
|One-tap sign-up   |`firebaseui.auth.CredentialHelper.GOOGLE_YOLO`        |
|None (disable)    |`firebaseui.auth.CredentialHelper.NONE`               |

### Available providers

|Provider          |Value                                           |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
|Google            |`firebase.auth.GoogleAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID`  |
|Facebook          |`firebase.auth.FacebookAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID`|
|Twitter           |`firebase.auth.TwitterAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID` |
|Github            |`firebase.auth.GithubAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID`  |
|Email and password|`firebase.auth.EmailAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID`   |
|Phone number      |`firebase.auth.PhoneAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID`   |

### Configure OAuth providers

To specify custom scopes, or custom OAuth parameters per provider, you can pass
an object instead of just the provider value:

```javascript
ui.start('#firebaseui-auth-container', {
  signInOptions: [
    {
      provider: firebase.auth.GoogleAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID,
      scopes: [
        'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.login'
      ],
      customParameters: {
        // Forces account selection even when one account
        // is available.
        prompt: 'select_account'
      }
    },
    {
      provider: firebase.auth.FacebookAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID,
      scopes: [
        'public_profile',
        'email',
        'user_likes',
        'user_friends'
      ],
      customParameters: {
        // Forces password re-entry.
        auth_type: 'reauthenticate'
      }
    },
    firebase.auth.TwitterAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID, // Twitter does not support scopes.
    firebase.auth.EmailAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID // Other providers don't need to be given as object.
  ]
});
```

### Configure Email Provider

The `EmailAuthProvider` can be configured to require the user to enter a display name (defaults to `true`).

```javascript
ui.start('#firebaseui-auth-container', {
  signInOptions: [
    {
      provider: firebase.auth.EmailAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID,
      requireDisplayName: false
    }
  ]
});
```

### Configure Phone Provider

The `PhoneAuthProvider` can be configured with custom reCAPTCHA parameters
whether reCAPTCHA is visible or invisible (defaults to `normal`). Refer to the
[reCAPTCHA API docs](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/display) for
more details.

The default country to select in the phone number input can also be set.
[List of supported country codes](javascript/data/README.md). If unspecified,
the phone number input will default to the United States (+1).

The following options are currently supported. Any other
parameters will be ignored.

```javascript
ui.start('#firebaseui-auth-container', {
  signInOptions: [
    {
      provider: firebase.auth.PhoneAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID,
      recaptchaParameters: {
        type: 'image', // 'audio'
        size: 'normal', // 'invisible' or 'compact'
        badge: 'bottomleft' //' bottomright' or 'inline' applies to invisible.
      },
      defaultCountry: 'GB', // Set default country to the United Kingdom (+44).
      // For prefilling the national number, set defaultNationNumber.
      // This will only be observed if only phone Auth provider is used since
      // for multiple providers, the NASCAR screen will always render first
      // with a 'sign in with phone number' button.
      defaultNationalNumber: '1234567890',
      // You can also pass the full phone number string instead of the
      // 'defaultCountry' and 'defaultNationalNumber'. However, in this case,
      // the first country ID that matches the country code will be used to
      // populate the country selector. So for countries that share the same
      // country code, the selected country may not be the expected one.
      // In that case, pass the 'defaultCountry' instead to ensure the exact
      // country is selected. The 'defaultCountry' and 'defaultNationaNumber'
      // will always have higher priority than 'loginHint' which will be ignored
      // in their favor. In this case, the default country will be 'GB' even
      // though 'loginHint' specified the country code as '+1'.
      loginHint: '+11234567890'
    }
  ]
});
```

### Sign In Flows

Two sign in flows are available:

- `redirect`, the default, will perform a full page redirect to the sign-in page
of the provider (Google, Facebook...). This is recommended for mobile apps.
- The `popup` flow will open a popup to the sign-in page of the provider. If the
popup is blocked by the browser, it will fall back to a full page redirect.

### Available callbacks

#### `signInSuccessWithAuthResult(authResult, redirectUrl)`

The `signInSuccessWithAuthResult` callback is invoked when user signs in successfully.
The authResult provided here is a `firebaseui.auth.AuthResult` object, which includes the current logged in user, the credential used to sign in the user, additional user info indicating if the user is new or existing and operation type like 'signIn' or 'link'. This callback will replace `signInSuccess` in future.

**Parameters:**

|Name         |Type                          | Optional|Description                                                                                                                                                              |
|-------------|------------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`authResult`|`firebaseui.auth.AuthResult`   |No       |The AuthResult of successful sign-in operation. The AuthResult object has same signature as `firebase.auth.UserCredential`.|
|`redirectUrl`|`string`                      |Yes      |The URL where the user is redirected after the callback finishes. It will only be given if you [overwrite the sign-in success URL](#overwriting-the-sign-in-success-url).|

**Should return: `boolean`**

If the callback returns `true`, then the page is automatically redirected
depending on the case:

- If no `signInSuccessUrl` parameter was given in the URL (See:
[Overwriting the sign-in success URL](#overwriting-the-sign-in-success-url))
then the default `signInSuccessUrl` in config is used.
- If the value is provided in the URL, that value will be used instead of the
static `signInSuccessUrl` in config.

If the callback returns `false` or nothing, the page is not automatically
redirected.

#### `signInSuccess(currentUser, credential, redirectUrl)`

This callback will be deprecated and will be replaced by `signInSuccessWithAuthResult` which takes `firebaseui.auth.AuthResult`.

**Parameters:**

|Name         |Type                          | Optional|Description                                                                                                                                                              |
|-------------|------------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`currentUser`|`firebase.User`               |No       |The logged in user.                                                                                                                                                      |
|`credential` |`firebase.auth.AuthCredential`|Yes      |The credential used to sign in the user.                                                                                                                                  |
|`redirectUrl`|`string`                      |Yes      |The URL where the user is redirected after the callback finishes. It will only be given if you [overwrite the sign-in success URL](#overwriting-the-sign-in-success-url).|

**Should return: `boolean`**

If the callback returns `true`, then the page is automatically redirected
depending on the case:

- If no `signInSuccessUrl` parameter was given in the URL (See:
[Overwriting the sign-in success URL](#overwriting-the-sign-in-success-url))
then the default `signInSuccessUrl` in config is used.
- If the value is provided in the URL, that value will be used instead of the
static `signInSuccessUrl` in config.

If the callback returns `false` or nothing, the page is not automatically
redirected.

#### `signInFailure(error)`

The `signInFailure` callback is provided to handle any unrecoverable error
encountered during the sign-in process.
The error provided here is a `firebaseui.auth.AuthUIError` error with the
following properties.

**firebaseui.auth.AuthUIError properties:**

|Name     |Type            |Optional |Description            |
|---------|----------------|---------|-----------------------|
|`code`   |`string`        |No       |The corresponding error code. Currently the only error code supported is `firebaseui/anonymous-upgrade-merge-conflict`   |
|`credential` |`firebase.auth.AuthCredential`|Yes      |The existing non-anonymous user credential the user tried to sign in with.|

**Should return: `Promise<void>|void`**

FirebaseUI will wait for the returned promise to handle the reported error
before clearing the UI. If no promise is returned, the UI will be cleared on
completion. Even when this callback resolves, `signInSuccessWithAuthResult`
callback will not be triggered.

This callback is required when `autoUpgradeAnonymousUsers` is enabled.

#### `uiShown()`

This callback is triggered the first time the widget UI is rendered. This is
useful for cases where the application should display a custom loader before
FirebaseUI is displayed.

### Upgrading anonymous users

#### Enabling anonymous user upgrade

When an anonymous user signs in or signs up with a permanent account, you want
to be sure the user can continue with what they were doing before signing up.
For example, an anonymous user might have items in their shopping cart.
At check-out, you prompt the user to sign in or sign up. After the user is
signed in, the user's shopping cart should contain any items the user added
while signed in anonymously.

To support this behavior, FirebaseUI makes it easy to "upgrade" an anonymous
account to a permanent account. To do so, simply set `autoUpgradeAnonymousUsers`
to `true` when you configure the sign-in UI (this option is disabled by
default).

FirebaseUI links the new credential with the anonymous account using Firebase
Auth's `linkWithCredential` method:
```javascript
anonymousUser.linkWithCredential(permanentCredential);
```
The user will retain the same `uid` at the end of the flow and all data keyed
on that identifier would still be associated with that same user.

#### Handling anonymous user upgrade merge conflicts

There are cases when a user, initially signed in anonymously, tries to
upgrade to an existing Firebase user. For example, a user may have signed up
with a Google credential on another device. When trying to upgrade to the
existing Google user, an error `auth/credential-already-in-use` will be thrown
by Firebase Auth as an existing user cannot be linked to another existing user.
No two users can share the same credential. In that case, both user data
have to be merged before one user is discarded (typically the anonymous user).
In the case above, the anonymous user shopping cart will be copied locally,
the anonymous user will be deleted and then the user is signed in with the
permanent credential. The anonymous user data in temporary storage will be
copied back to the non-anonymous user.

FirebaseUI will trigger the `signInFailure` callback with an error code
`firebaseui/anonymous-upgrade-merge-conflict` when the above occurs. The error
object will also contain the permanent credential.
Sign-in with the permanent credential should be triggered in the callback to
complete sign-in.
Before sign-in can be completed via
`auth.signInWithCredential(error.credential)`, the data of the anonymous user
must be copied and the anonymous user deleted. After sign-in completion, the
data has to be copied back to the non-anonymous user. An example below
illustrates how this flow would work if user data is persisted using Firebase
Realtime Database.

**Example:**

```javascript
// Temp variable to hold the anonymous user data if needed.
var data = null;
// Hold a reference to the anonymous current user.
var anonymousUser = firebase.auth().currentUser;
ui.start('#firebaseui-auth-container', {
  // Whether to upgrade anonymous users should be explicitly provided.
  // The user must already be signed in anonymously before FirebaseUI is
  // rendered.
  autoUpgradeAnonymousUsers: true,
  signInSuccessUrl: '<url-to-redirect-to-on-success>',
  signInOptions: [
    firebase.auth.GoogleAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID,
    firebase.auth.FacebookAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID,
    firebase.auth.EmailAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID,
    firebase.auth.PhoneAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID
  ],
  callbacks: {
    signInSuccessWithAuthResult: function(authResult, redirectUrl) {
      // Process result. This will not trigger on merge conflicts.
      // On success redirect to signInSuccessUrl.
      return true;
    },
    // signInFailure callback must be provided to handle merge conflicts which
    // occur when an existing credential is linked to an anonymous user.
    signInFailure: function(error) {
      // For merge conflicts, the error.code will be
      // 'firebaseui/anonymous-upgrade-merge-conflict'.
      if (error.code != 'firebaseui/anonymous-upgrade-merge-conflict') {
        return Promise.resolve();
      }
      // The credential the user tried to sign in with.
      var cred = error.credential;
      // If using Firebase Realtime Database. The anonymous user data has to be
      // copied to the non-anonymous user.
      var app = firebase.app();
      // Save anonymous user data first.
      return app.database().ref('users/' + firebase.auth().currentUser.uid)
          .once('value')
          .then(function(snapshot) {
            data = snapshot.val();
            // This will trigger onAuthStateChanged listener which
            // could trigger a redirect to another page.
            // Ensure the upgrade flow is not interrupted by that callback
            // and that this is given enough time to complete before
            // redirection.
            return firebase.auth().signInWithCredential(cred);
          })
          .then(function(user) {
            // Original Anonymous Auth instance now has the new user.
            return app.database().ref('users/' + user.uid).set(data);
          })
          .then(function() {
            // Delete anonymnous user.
            return anonymousUser.delete();
          }).then(function() {
            // Clear data in case a new user signs in, and the state change
            // triggers.
            data = null;
            // FirebaseUI will reset and the UI cleared when this promise
            // resolves.
            // signInSuccessWithAuthResult will not run. Successful sign-in
            // logic has to be run explicitly.
            window.location.assign('<url-to-redirect-to-on-success>');
          });

    }
  }
});
```


## Customizing FirebaseUI for authentication

Currently, FirebaseUI does not offer customization out of the box. However, the
HTML around the widget is not affected by it so you can display everything you
want around the widget container.

## Advanced

### FirebaseUI widget modes

Upon initialization, FirebaseUI will look for the `mode` parameter in the URL.
Depending on the value of this parameter, it will trigger a specific mode. When
no `mode` parameter is found, it will default to the sign-in mode.

You can change the name of this parameter with the `queryParameterForWidgetMode`
configuration parameter.

|Query parameter value|Description |
|---------------------|------------|
|`?mode=select`       |Sign-in mode|

**Example:**

    https://<url-of-the-widget>?mode=select

### Overwriting the sign-in success URL

You can pass a query parameter to the widget's URL that will overwrite the URL
the user is redirected to after a successful sign-in. If you do so, you must set
the configuration `signInSuccessUrl` value (even if it will be overwritten).
When passing the redirect URL this way, the `signInSuccessWithAuthResult`
callback will receive the value as the `redirectUrl` argument.

You **must include the mode explicitly** in the URL when using the
`signInSuccessUrl` parameter, otherwise FirebaseUI will directly redirect to the
URL specified.

You can change the name of this parameter with the
`queryParameterForSignInSuccessUrl` configuration parameter.

**Example:**

`https://<url-of-the-widget>?mode=select&signInSuccessUrl=signedIn.html` will
redirect the user to `https://<url-of-the-widget>/signedIn.html` after a
successful sign-in flow.

## Developer Setup

### Dependencies

To set up a development environment to build FirebaseUI from source, you must
have the following installed:
- Node.js (>= 6.0.0)
- npm (should be included with Node.js)
- Java Runtime Environment

In order to run the demo and tests, you must also have:
- Python (2.7)

Download the FirebaseUI source and its dependencies with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-web.git
cd firebaseui-web
npm install
```

### Building FirebaseUI

To build the library, run:
```bash
npm run build
```

This will create output files in the `dist/` folder.

To build a localized JavaScript binary, run:
```bash
npm run build build-js-{LANGUAGE_CODE}
```
where `{LANGUAGE_CODE}` is replaced by the
[code of the language you want](LANGUAGES.md). For example, the French binary
can be built with `npm run build build-js-fr`. This will create a binary
`firebaseui__fr.js` in the `dist/` folder.

To build a localized npm FirebaseUI module, run:
```bash
npm run build build-npm-{LANGUAGE_CODE}
```
Make sure all underscore symbols in the `LANGUAGE_CODE` are replaced with
dashes.
This will generate `dist/npm__{LANGUAGE_CODE}.js`.
You can then import/require it:
```javascript
import firebaseui from './npm__{LANGUAGE_CODE}';
```

### Running the demo app

To run the demo app, you must have a Firebase project set up on the
[Firebase Console](https://firebase.google.com/console). Copy
`demo/public/sample-config.js` to `demo/public/config.js`:

```bash
cp demo/public/sample-config.js demo/public/config.js
```

Copy the data from the "Add Firebase to your web app" flow in Firebase Console.
Next, run

```bash
npm run demo
```

This will start a local server serving a FirebaseUI demo app with all local
changes. More details can be found in the [demo app folder](demo/), covering
how to configure the app to be deployed on a Firebase Hosting instance.

### Running unit tests.

All unit tests can be run on the command line (via PhantomJS) with:

```bash
npm test
```

Alternatively, the unit tests can be run manually by running

```bash
npm run serve
```

Then, all unit tests can be run at: http://localhost:4000/buildtools/all_tests.html
You can also run tests individually by accessing each HTML file under
`generated/tests`, for example: http://localhost:4000/generated/tests/javascript/widgets/authui_test.html

### Run tests using SauceLabs

*You need a [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com/) account to run tests on
SauceLabs.*

Go to your SauceLab account, under "My Account", and copy paste the access key.
Now export the following variables, *in two Terminal windows*:

```bash
export SAUCE_USERNAME=<your username>
export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=<the copy pasted access key>
```

 Then, in one Terminal window, start SauceConnect:

 ```bash
./buildtools/sauce_connect.sh
```

Take note of the "Tunnel Identifier" value logged in the terminal,at the top. In
the other terminal that has the exported variables, run the tests:

```bash
npm test -- --saucelabs --tunnelIdentifier=<the tunnel identifier>
```

## Cordova Setup

### Introduction

FirebaseUI sign-in widget supports Cordova applications. This includes
email/password and all OAuth providers (Google, Facebook, Twitter and GitHub).
Phone authentication is not supported due to the limitation in the underlying
Firebase core SDK.

### Available providers

|Provider          |Value                                           |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
|Google            |`firebase.auth.GoogleAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID`  |
|Facebook          |`firebase.auth.FacebookAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID`|
|Twitter           |`firebase.auth.TwitterAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID` |
|Github            |`firebase.auth.GithubAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID`  |
|Email and password|`firebase.auth.EmailAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID`   |

### Setup and Usage

In order to integrate FirebaseUI with your Cordova application, you need to
follow these steps:

- Install the necessary Cordova plugins, make the necessary Firebase Console
changes and update your config.xml file as documented in
[OAuth Sign-In for Cordova](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/cordova)
- After you have successfully configured your application, you can use
FirebaseUI in your Cordova application just like any other traditional browser
applications.

Keep in mind the following while you set up the app:
- Only `redirect` `signInFlow` is supported as Firebase Auth does not support
`popup` mode for Cordova.
- `firebase.auth.PhoneAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID` is not currently supported.
- As the application runs within an embedded webview, `accountchooser.com` will
always be disabled.
- If you are providing a `Content-Security-Policy` make sure you add the
appropriate exceptions for FirebaseUI resources (`style-src`, `media-src`,
`img-src`, `script-src`, etc.) and underlying Firebase JS SDK.

## React DOM Setup

In React DOM applications use the [FirebaseUI Web React Wrapper](https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-web-react).

## Known issues

### Firebase Auth does not work in Safari private browsing

When a user has enabled the private browsing mode in Safari, the web storage is
disabled. This currently results in an error being thrown upon Firebase Auth
initialization. Therefore, when following the snippets above, FirebaseUI will
never get initialized and no UI will be displayed.

### Tips for Single Page apps (`UI Widget is already rendered on the page` warning)

When re-rendering the FirebaseUI Auth widget (for instance after signing in a
user, signing her out and trying to sign her in again), it will sometimes log a
warning:

> UI Widget is already rendered on the page and is pending some user
> interaction. Only one widget instance can be rendered per page. The previous
> instance has been automatically reset.

This happens when the UI widget was in a pending state, i.e. the user was in the
middle of performing a sign-in flow. You should generally avoid re-rendering the
widget in the middle of an action, but if you do, to avoid the warning, you
should use the `reset()` method before re-rendering the widget.

### Tips for initializing a new UI instance with the same Auth instance

When trying to initialize a new UI widget with the same Auth instance, you will
get an `app/duplicate-app` error. In general, you should keep a reference to
the AuthUI instance and instead call `reset()` and then `start(...)` again to
re-render the widget.

If you don't keep a reference to that AuthUI instance, you can get the reference
by calling `firebaseui.auth.AuthUI.getInstance(appId)` where `appId` is the same
as the optional one used to initialize the AuthUI instance. If none was provided
just call `firebaseui.auth.AuthUI.getInstance()`.

This is the recommended way but you also have the option to delete the AuthUI
instance by calling `ui.delete()` which returns a promise that resolves on
successful deletion. You can then initialize a new UI instance with the same
Auth instance without getting the `app/duplicate-app` error. At any time, you
can only have one AuthUI instance with the same `appId` or the same Auth
instance.


### FirebaseUI is broken in IE11 when deployed on a local server accessed through `localhost` (but works when deployed on a remote server)

Several developers reported issues with IE11 when testing the widget integration on a server deployed locally, accessing the application through a `localhost` address. However, it doesn't impact applications deployed on a server (as you can verify in the [demo app](https://fir-ui-demo-84a6c.firebaseapp.com/)).

## Release Notes

**Latest**: https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-web/releases/latest

**For v1.0.0 and superior:** https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-web/releases

### 0.5.0

See the milestone [0.5.0](https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-web/milestone/1)
for the issues covered in this release. Below is a summary of the most important
ones:

- FirebaseUI now supports **Single Page Application**: a `reset` method was
added to allow to dispose of the widget. When the user leaves a page where the
FirebaseUI widget was rendered (for instance in the `componentWillUnmount`
method of a React component), call the `reset` method of the
`firebaseui.auth.AuthUI` instance you created. Also, call the `reset` method
before rendering again the widget if one has already been rendered on the page.
Please refer to the [demo app](demo/) for guidance on how to use FirebaseUI in a
Single Page Application context.
- **Custom scopes** can now be added for each provider. See [Configure OAuth providers](configure-oauth-providers).
- Several issues, different but related to the `displayName` not being present
after sign up with email and password, have been fixed.
- A new config parameter has been added: `signInFlow`. It allows to specify
whether the Identity Providers sign in flows should be done through `redirect`
(the default) or `popup`. See [Sign In Flows](sign-in-flows).
